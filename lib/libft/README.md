# 42-libft

The first project of the core curriculum of 42 Berlin. A static library of common C functions. At school we have a linting program called norminette limitint the lenght of the functions to 25 lines and dictating what we can do and not do. For example we are not allowed to use for loops, but while loops and we are not allowed to define variables in one line.



## What I learned then
- Don't mess around with pointers.
- The standard library has its own bugs.  Recreating the original functions exposes their sometimes unexpected weird behaviour.
- It is a good learning opportunity to get acquanited with the C language.

## What I know now
use of the keywords constant.  Inline keywords macros


## Example with the evolution of strlen 


## malloc
Then the malloc case quoting from kerrisk malloc(0) case returns a pointer to be free
How to force the mallocs to fail with ulimit -m 50 (or other number)

## The case of strncpy 




## adding printf and get_next_line

## Bad functions in C
The functions which are supposed to be bad… buffer overflow..
Link to the printf case…
